# Project Overview

## Project Description

My project is twofold: first, a redesign of the website for the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center; second, an added section to their website with some data infographics.

| [Acumen](https://acumen.org/)| - homepage layout <br> - drop downs | 
| [Alliance](https://alliance.nyc/)| - menu bar <br> - sliding images  |

## MVP 

All content from current site as it exists: directions, calendars, donation information, company information.
On top of that, a visual representation of some of their client data. 

## POST MVP

Infographics or general information about harm reduction - need to get access to some data on this.
